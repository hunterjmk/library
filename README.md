# library

Hello everybody,

I'm back with a bit more of Js. I am now getting into the serious parts of js. It has not been easy to learn about OOP.

I think this project will help me cement all that I have about object constructors, prototypes and prototypal inheritance. woooh! Did I get that right?

Hopefully.

# Update
I was able to go through the project in record time. I took a 3 day break but I'm it's done now. The library has the following features:
1. You can add and remove books from it.
2. You can toggle read status with the click of a button.
3. Reloading the page takes away all the user added books. I didn't configure a storage. I'm supposed to do that much later according to the curriculum.

I had a 2 challenges in this project:
1. Most prominent one was figuring out how to delete book cards and it's book object in the lib array. I got that one out with some debugging. was fun!
2. Displaying  the book cards also took me out a bit. Nothing big, just had to figure my way out of an infinite loop, haha! I couldn't understand why the page broke when I wanted to display. Assumed my machine was lightweight before I figured out the issue. Embarrassing, I know!!!

There you go. I'm to finally complete this projext. Solidified a couple of things I picked up in earlier projects. Looking forward to revisiting this project some day!

Cheers y'all!
