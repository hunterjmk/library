# library

Hello everybody,

I'm back with a bit more of Js. I am now getting into the serious parts of js. It has not been easy to learn about OOP.

I think this project will help me cement all that I have about object constructors, prototypes and prototypal inheritance. woooh! Did I get that right?

Hopefully.

Cheers y'all!
